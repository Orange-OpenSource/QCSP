        ## Ex. index [None, i, :, :] will represent the shift of all OFDM symbols relatively to the shift in symbol i (x/i). 
        ## Hence [None, i, i, :] should look like [1., 0., 0., ...], because the shift relatively to itself is 0 (i/i).
        ## And [None, i, m, :] should have a 1. at the index pm-pi.
        ## The shift should be always read as positive, modulo fft_size. So shift of 1 relative to 0 is 1 (=1-0). But shift of 0 relative to 1 is fft_size-1 (because 1 + fft_size-1 [fft_size] = 0)
